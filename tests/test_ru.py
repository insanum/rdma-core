Tests for the Reliable Unconnected QPs.

Two halves. The API tests exercise the objects a UET device adds - jobs,
address tables, job keys and RU queue pairs - on a single context, and check
both that the legal thing works and that the illegal thing is refused. The
traffic tests run real messages between two players on the one device, which
is how every pyverbs traffic test is written and, for this device, works
because a frame addressed to its own MAC is delivered internally.
